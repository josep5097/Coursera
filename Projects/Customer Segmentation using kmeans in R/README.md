# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering in R

## About Guided Project

Now we will perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering in R. We will accomplish this by completing each task in the project:

* Import the required packages into R

* Import and explore the dataset

* Visualize the Gender and Age variables

* Visualize the annual income and spending score variables

* Understand the concept of K-Means

* Obtain the optimal number of clusters

* Perform K-Means clustering on the data

* Perform Principal Component Analysis

* Visualize the different customers segments
