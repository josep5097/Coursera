Project Overview
Welcome to Your Guided Project!
This is an intermediate project-based course which should take approximately 1 hour to finish. 

We will be tackling a real-world problem in computer vision called segmentation.  Segmentation means taking an image and partitioning it into different regions that capture the different elements of interest in the scene.

We will attack this problem using an unsupervised learning technique called K-means.

By the end of this project, you will have segmented an image with unsupervised learning, using code you will write in Python.

Meet Your Instructor 
Hi, my name is Daniel Romaniuk and I will be taking you through this Guided Project.

I hold degrees in mechanical engineering and computer science, and my background is in civil flight simulation.  My goal with this project is to help you take some early steps toward machine learning, a fascinating field that has captured my interest and changed my mind about what computers can do.

Guided Project Structure
This Guided Project is divided into 4 parts:

Project Overview: This introductory reading material.

Hands-on Project: The hands on project that we will work on together

Graded Quiz: The final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the project successfully.

Learner Survey: Tell us what you thought about this guided project! 

Earn Your Certificate
After you have completed the hands-on project, you will be able to assess your knowledge using a graded assignment on Coursera. Score higher than 80% to earn your certificate!
